# PPG/ECG Wearable Devices for Atrial Fibrillation Diagnosis System

This is a Kotlin-based application used for the PPG/ECG Wearable Devices for Atrial Fibrillation Diagnosis System thesis.

The application is designed to work with PPG and ECG wearable devices, and can be used for the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. 
This application uploads the data collected from the wearable device to the server using the SFTP protocol.

To run the application, you will need the following:
- Kotlin 1.8 or higher
- Android Studio 4.0 or higher
- PPG and ECG wearable devices (BLE protocol)
